## What and Why

This repo is a thorough, but quick way to show my work and work through learning/getting up to speed on a few things. These are:
- JS reading and challenges provided by a collegue
- Setting up and getting into the flow of TDD
- Setting up and running very basic CI
- And, finally, poking around GitHub to see how it's changed in the last few years
